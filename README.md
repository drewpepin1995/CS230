- The Gaming Room is a mobile game creator with an application currently compatible with Androids. The Gaming Room would like to make their application web-based and complatible across all platforms. 
- In order to help with this development, I gave an extensive breakdown of the necessary developement requirements, including server, client, and dev tool requirements for different platforms. 
- The design document helped in my coding as it gave me a good starting point. The UML Class Diagram helped me map out relationships between classes and that gave me a good sense of direction prior to coding. 
- Given the opportunity, I would choose to revice/rework the recomendations section after gaining some more experience with different platforms and softwares. 
- User needs always plays a big role when developing an application like this one. You want to ensure you're providing the user with the best experience possible when they use your game. Speed and ease of use would be the top 2 things users would look for in my opinion, so ensuring our application has those characteristics is important. 
- When I approach designing software, I like to break everything up into smaller pieces. When you look at a large project / idea it can be overwhelming, but when you set small goals and pieces the overall project will come together easier with less stress.
